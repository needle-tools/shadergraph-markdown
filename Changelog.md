## [1.2.0] - 2021-10-02
- bumped version to stable for AssetStore release after testing in production

## [1.2.0-pre.2] - 2021-09-15
- fixed usage with Amplify on Built-In only (no SRPs in project)
- changed Amplify sample shader to use Built-In, not URP

## [1.2.0-pre] - 2021-09-15
- added support for blackboard categories in 2021.2+

## [1.1.4] - 2021-06-28
- added explicitly specified inlined properties (`Base Map && _BaseColor`) to allow e.g. virtual texture slots to use inlined properties
- added callback `MarkdownSGExtensions.RegisterCustomBaseShaderGUI` to specify a base shader GUI
   - for HDRP ShaderGraph shaders the base shader GUI was already automatically added
   - for Amplify, you can now use the above callback to register one per shader (e.g. `UnityEditor.Rendering.HighDefinition.LitShaderGraphGUI`)
   - the base shader GUI is called with all properties that haven't been processed by `MarkdownShaderGUI`

## [1.1.3] - 2021-06-15
- fixed some issues with conditions parsing and exceptions
- fixed log message when editing gradients

- fixed gradient texture picker sometimes showing texture preview instead
- added Uber shader sample with complex conditions
- added GradientDrawer script (same as GradientGeneratorDrawer) and removed legacy GradientDrawer ScriptableObjects

## [1.1.0] - 2021-06-05
- fixed some inline drawing issues
- fixed GradientGenerator drawer sometimes losing gradient reference

- added: complex conditions (e.g. `[_Value > 0]`, `[_OPTION_A || _OPTION_B]`)
- added: generate gradients from arbitrary textures to GradientGenerator drawer
- added: quickly switch to other gradients based on generated textures

## [1.0.3] - 2021-05-18
- fixed rare NullReference exception when changing shaders on a closed material that uses MarkdownShaderGUI
- fixed samples in AssetStore version

## [1.0.2] - 2021-05-03

- fixed disappearing custom drawers when exiting play mode with Domain Reload disabled
- fixed vector sliders not showing animation state (red/blue overlay)

## [0.5.1-exp] - 2021-02-10
- fixed texture field not being square in some cases
- added tiling/offset inline drawer. Usage:
  ```
  _MyTexture && (Texture2D)
  _MyTexture_ST (Vector)
  ```
- added texture keyword helpers - bool keywords with the same name as a texture will automatically be set on texture changes.
  This helps with performance improvements (making variants without texture access). Usage:
  ```
  _BumpMap (Texture2D)
  _BUMPMAP (Bool Keyword) // will be set automatically depending on texture being set
  ```
